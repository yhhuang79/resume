        Finally, I'm mainly responsible for the development of TaiwanAir -  air quality monitoring and prediction platform for heat waves. This plan mainly uses technologies such as HTML 5︑Bootstroop︑JQuery︑NodeJS in Front-end. The air quality prediction part uses the Spark Framework because it involves big data computing. In backend part uses Apache Spark, Apache Mesos, Marathon, Docker, RethinkDB and other technologies.
