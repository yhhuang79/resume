    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a full stack developer, and have enthusiastic research on various new technologies, from blockchain, to cloud, to algorithms, to hardware. I used to be a system architect of the Advanced Network Technology and Service Laboratory of Academia Sinica, developing PLASH location-aware services and human-to-computing platforms and the heat-wave plan TaiwanAir air quality monitoring and prediction platform. I once served as a volunteer for the Baton project, a lecturer in agile development combat camp, and also researched the Agile development process. I also competed in many programming contests and hackathons.

        At G-Coin, I’m mainly studying Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, and proposes the improvement of Proof of Work mechanism and the implementation of Hadoop HDFS distributed storage blockchain mechanism.
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2010 - 2016
      company: Institute of Information Science @ Academia Sinica, Taipei
      details: |
        During I worked at the Academia Sinica, I have developed PLASH location-aware service and human intelligence computing platform and its related subsystems. This platform uses technologies such as JAVA Spring Framework, Mule ESB, Apache ActiveMQ, PostgreSQL / PostGIS, and also uses HTML 5 in Front-end part to develop web pages and Android apps. 
        Participated in the development of myID-OpenID identity authentication platform and Daodin Digital Collection Android App development. In this plan, I was mainly responsible for writing the social network OAUTH connection part, including Facebook︑Twitter︑Plurk︑Google+/Picasa and other social network connections .
        Finally, I'm mainly responsible for the development of TaiwanAir -  air quality monitoring and prediction platform for heat waves. This plan mainly uses technologies such as HTML 5︑Bootstroop︑JQuery︑NodeJS in Front-end. The air quality prediction part uses the Spark Framework because it involves big data computing. In backend part uses Apache Spark, Apache Mesos, Marathon, Docker, RethinkDB and other technologies.

      company: National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung
      details: |
        During worked at National Taiwan Ocean University, I’m a research assistant and a student, My main research areas were Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Cognitive Radio (CR). I developed software-defined 802.11 MAC Layer using GNU Radio and USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) , and porting Spectrum Sensing to the embedded system development board Beagle Board. In addition, a passive MAC layer is developed on the NS2 network simulator.

      - title: Taiwan Air - Air quality monitoring and prediction platform
        link: "https://github.com/yhhuang79/uair"
        tagline: "Under climate change, heat waves are expected to occur frequently and continue to set historical records. In recent years, Taiwan has also been experiencing heat waves that lasted for several days. At the same time, it has also seen a rise in respiratory and cardiovascular disease mortality during the heatwave. In order to reduce the negative impact of heat waves, it is necessary to immediately construct a forward-looking vulnerability assessment to formulate heat wave adaptation strategies. In this project, I am responsible for constructing the <a href=\"http://taiwanair.plash.tw\">http://taiwanair.plash.tw</a> Taiwan Air air quality observation platform and the computing platform Spark / Hadoop environment.<br /><br />News report：<a href=\"http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/paper/1013976\">http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/paper/1013976</a>"
